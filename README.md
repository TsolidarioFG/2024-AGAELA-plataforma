# AGAELA APP objective

Create a user interface (UI) adapted to people with ALS, allowing them to send periodic forms called functional rating scale and barthel index to [AGAELA](https://agaela.es/).

To simplify the process, the app will manage periodic notifications reminding users to fill out the forms.

Additionally, the app will allow users change their personal information, perform social procedures and report incidents.

Finally, it is important to note that the information of a person with ALS can be managed by his carer, so the UI will change if the user logged in is a carer. A carer can manage the information of one or more people with ALS and must fill out a specific periodic form called caregiver overload.
